# Better Hacker News 🐈

This project was made as alternative of the website at https://news.ycombinator.com/.

It was made with the aim of having an easier to read interface, and uses the official Hacker News API to retrieve up to the top 500 stories.

Currently, the API requests are made in the browser, and will be replaced by a backend to reduce the number of requests made.
